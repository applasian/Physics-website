			  What is the Standard Model?
			  </u>
		  </h2>
		  
		  <p>
		  To have an idea of the standard model, find an object near you and ask yourself: What is this made out of?<br>
		  In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, physicists believed that all matter, including you, are made up of protons, neutrons and electrons.<br>
		  But then again, we ask the question: What are these protons, neutrons and electrons made up of?<br>
		  It wasn't until 1964 when Murray Gell-Mann and Geroge Zweig solved this puzzling problem by putting forth the idea of quarks.<br>
		  Certain combinations of quarks made up these particles but physicists soon realised quarks weren't the only fundamental particles there is.<br>
		  In fact, they discovered so many that categorised the elementary particles into what we know: quarks and leptons.<br>
		  Some particles are reponsible for forces that hold the universe together, others only exist for a blink of an eye.<br>
		  These elementary particles are just mere ingredients of the universes but with the drive the four forces, can nature create the universe we live in.

		  I do not know the copyright laws for stealing a <b>Stars Wars</b> quote but I must say, they are quite right!<br>
		  For anything to hold together, four fundamental forces need to exist. The most familiar one you heard of is the gravitiational force,<br>
		  without it, stars and galaxies would cease to exist!<br>
		  Anyways, the <b>four </b>forces that govern our universe include:
			  <ul>
				  <li>Electromagnetism</li>
				  <li>Strong nuclear force</li>
				  <li>Weak nuclear force</li>
				  <li>Gravitational force</li>
			  </ul>

		  <h3><u> Gravity</u> </h3>
		  Let's emphasise on the gravititational force because it is a bit weird compared to the other forces. In fact, it is the weakst force	 <br>
		  by far, around 10<sup>40</sup> times weaker than the electromagnetic force! Despite it's feebleness, Einstein was curious about how gravity worked,<br>
		  which after decades he was finally able to elegantly describe it with his famous theories of <i>General Relativity </i> and <i>Special Relativity</i>.<br>
		  The crux is that the Standard Model has a problem incorporating itself with Einstein's Theory. It cannot explain gravity in terms of particles,<br>
		  the best it can do it to hypothesise a particle called the <i>graviton</i>, which is yet to be discovered. So the SM is not complete so to say,<br>
		  we'll save the discussion for next time.

	  <div id="Electromagnetism">
	  <h3><u>Electromagnetism</u></h3>
	  
	  <p>
		The reason you can read this is because of the discovery of electromagnetism. Electromagnetism is constituted of electricity and magnetism <br>
		which are responsible for the interactions between electrically charged particles. Like magnets, like charges repel (- and - or + and +) while opposite charges <br>
		attract (+ and -). By building on this concept, we can explain a shocking amount about nature for example, how thunderstorms work, Earth's magnetic field, <br>
		and intermolecular forces. We humans need it for our computers, compasses, and even our existence. What you might not know is that light is an electromagnetic wave, <br>
		which we all know what light is. James Clerk Maxwell made things easier for us by proposing for equations by which we call Maxwell's equations:
		Do not fear the equations! It'll be explained in detail here. In case you're wondering, the integral and point form are <br>
		techincally the same thing.
		Electromagnetism is summed up by these four elegant equations which also describes the nature of light.
